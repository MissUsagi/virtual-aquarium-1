# 🐠 Simple Aquarium Project
Welcome to my project! This is a sandbox project where I'm experimenting with the Vue Composition API to enhance my skills. 
The primary goal of this project is to improve my capabilities and explore new techniques that will contribute to the development of a larger project I'm involved in **Kanji Learning app**.

## 🚧 Project Status
This project is under active development, and it's not yet fully responsive or feature-complete.  
I'm using it as a playground to learn and practice the Vue Composition API, so expect frequent changes and updates.

## 🛠️ Planned Features
- **Responsiveness**: Making the UI fully responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
- **Animations**: Improving animations for fish movements and interactions.
- **Mini Game**: Fish will have a hunger indicator, and you will have to feed
